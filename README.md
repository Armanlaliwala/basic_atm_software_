The Atm class is a simple Python-based simulation of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). This implementation allows users to:  Create a PIN and set an initial balance.  Change the existing PIN.  Check their account balance.  Withdraw funds from their account.  Each operation is protected by a PIN for security, ensuring only authorized access.
